# YouTube-Music-for-Desktop
I was disappointed that YouTube hasn't made a desktop client for YouTube Music yet, so I decided to make one myself. All this is is just an Electron app with a webview. To use this on Windows, just open Electron.exe or use the "YouTube Music" shortcut. Also, thanks to /u/XtremeCookie for inspiring me with your MinimalMessages application.
